I am Bill Chen, a technology entrepreneur, investor and tinkerer. I was a Y Combinator founder (S24). Before that, I worked at Retool as a deployed engineer, working with customers like Netflix, Google and Doordash. Before all of that I held stints at Meta, Morgan Stanley and Bytedance.

I was born in Shanghai. I moved to Canada when I was 9 and got my Bachelors from Columbia University. I currently live in San Francisco.

Here I post my thoughts on technology, entrepreneurship, and investing. All views are my own and do not represent my employers, current or past.
