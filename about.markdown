I am Bill Chen, I work on Applied AI and Startups at OpenAI, where I mainly focus on agentic coding. I was also a [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) founder. Before that, I worked at [Retool](https://retool.com/) as a deployed engineer. Before all of that I held stints at Meta, Morgan Stanley and Bytedance.

I was born in Shanghai. I moved to Canada when I was 9 and got my Bachelors from Columbia. I currently live in San Francisco.

All views are my own and do not represent my employers, current or past.

Outside of everything "work" related, I enjoy [painting watercolors](https://www.instagram.com/chillbens_art/), taking photos,running and playing the piano.
